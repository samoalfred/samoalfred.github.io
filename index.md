Samuel Onimpa Alfred is a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/) in Ann Arbor, Michigan. He previously worked as a Researcher at [George Mason University](https://www.gmu.edu/). He holds a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Mechanical Engineering from the [University of Benin](https://www.uniben.edu/), Nigeria, and Master of Science and Master of Engineering degrees in Mechanical Engineering from the [University of Portsmouth](https://www.port.ac.uk/), United Kingdom, and [Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute](https://www.rpi.edu/), United States, respectively. He earned his PhD in Mechanical Engineering with a dissertation titled “*Fatigue of Additively Manufactured Nickel-Based Superalloys Under Harsh Environments.*”

His research broadly focuses on understanding the mechanisms of material failure and predicting failure behavior under various environmental and loading conditions. To achieve this, he integrates experimental characterization, computational modeling, and data-driven techniques to advance fundamental knowledge and improve the reliability assessment of engineering materials.
