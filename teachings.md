My teaching philosophy is rooted in the belief that engineering education should empower students to think critically, solve complex problems, and develop strong physical intuition. I strive to cultivate an adaptable skill set in my students through a foundation in quantitative reasoning, problem decomposition, and a deep understanding of the physical behavior of materials and structures.

To support diverse learners, I incorporate multiple instructional strategies, including the use of visualizations, simulations, and real-world applications that make abstract concepts tangible. I value interactive learning environments that encourage active participation and foster intellectual curiosity. Assessment is used not only to measure learning but also to guide and motivate student growth.

By connecting theory to practice and encouraging inquiry-based learning, I aim to prepare students to approach emerging engineering challenges with creativity, confidence, and ethical responsibility.
